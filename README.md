# Geometric-Shapes-OOP-Project
I made this small Python project to model different shapes using classes. It includes a circle, a square, and a triangle, and it can describe each shape and calculate its area. I used inheritance and super() so the shapes can share common features and the code stays organized, making it easy to add new shapes later.
