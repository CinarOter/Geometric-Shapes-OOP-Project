Geometric Shapes Project

This is a small Python project I made to explore object-oriented programming. It models different shapes: a circle, a square, and a triangle. The program can describe each shape and calculate its area.

I created a base Shape class for common features like color and whether the shape is filled. Each shape class builds on it and adds its own details, like radius, width, or height. This project shows how inheritance and method overriding work in a simple and organized way.

It’s a fun project that demonstrates how Python can organize code efficiently and makes it easy to add more shapes in the future.

Key Features
Uses inheritance so common features are in the parent Shape class
Demonstrates polymorphism by giving each shape its own describe method
Readable code with formatted output
Good practice for learning OOP basics in Python

Example Output
It is red and filled.
It is a circle with an area of 78.54cm²

It is blue and not filled.
It is a square with an area of 36.00cm²

It is yellow and filled.
It is a triangle with an area of 28.00cm²
