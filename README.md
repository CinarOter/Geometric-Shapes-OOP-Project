# Geometric Shapes Project

This is a small Python project I made to explore Python classes. It models different shapes: a circle, a square, and a triangle. The program can describe each shape and calculate its area.  

I created a base Shape class for common features like color and whether the shape is filled. Each shape class builds on it and adds its own details, like radius, width, or height. I used inheritance and super() so the shapes can share common features and the code stays organized. This makes it easy to add new shapes in the future.  

It’s a fun project that shows how Python can organize code clearly and efficiently.  

**Key Features**  
* Uses inheritance so common features are in the parent Shape class  
* Each shape has its own describe() method to provide its details  
* Readable code with formatted output  
* Good practice for learning Python classes and code reuse  

**Example Output**  
It is red and filled.  
It is a circle with an area of 78.54cm²  

It is blue and not filled.  
It is a square with an area of 36.00cm²  

It is yellow and filled.  
It is a triangle with an area of 28.00cm²
